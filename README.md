## Heavy Directory Structure

The `heavy` directory is used to store media files that are not tracked by Git. Please ensure that the following folder structure is maintained within the `heavy` directory:

heavy/

├── Nyersanyagok/

│ ├── 1st curse/

│ │ ├── main camera/

│ │ ├── secondary camera/

│ │ └── sounds and screams/

## Folder Descriptions

- **Nyersanyagok/**: This folder contains raw materials for the project.
  - **1st curse/**: Subfolder for the "1st curse" project.
    - **main camera/**: Contains footage from the main camera.
    - **secondary camera/**: Contains footage from the secondary camera.
    - **sounds and screams/**: Contains sound effects and audio files.

Please be wise that in order for this setup to work correctly, all media files that were once shared should have the same name as ever (so never rename) in this local directory structure to avoid unnecessary hassle.

## Notes

- Ensure all media files are placed in the appropriate folders.
- This `heavy` directory is added to `.gitignore` and should not be tracked by Git. Any media files should be placed here locally but will not be included in the repository.

## Release

Upon rendering, make sure to upload the files to the designated [OneDrive folder](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AjrommP_En30grp-7GfF8uCa0X_-bQ?e=zVZBKf).
