## Heavy Directory Structure

Please put all files on your harddrive in the Nyersanyagok directory.

├── Nyersanyagok/

│ ├── 1st curse/

│ │ ├── main camera/

│ │ ├── secondary camera/

│ │ └── sounds and screams/

## Folder Descriptions

- **Nyersanyagok/**: This folder contains raw materials for the project.
  - **1st curse/**: Subfolder for the "1st curse" project.
    - **main camera/**: Contains footage from the main camera.
    - **secondary camera/**: Contains footage from the secondary camera.
    - **sounds and screams/**: Contains sound effects and audio files.

Please be wise that in order for this setup to work correctly, all media files that were once shared should have the same name as ever (so never rename) in this local directory structure to avoid unnecessary hassle.

## Notes

- Ensure all media files are placed in the appropriate folders.

## Release

Upon rendering, make sure to upload the files to the designated [OneDrive folder](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AjrommP_En30grp-7GfF8uCa0X_-bQ?e=zVZBKf).
